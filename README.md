# Generalized-Equalization-Model
This project contains a demo of generalized equalization model for image enhancement. 

## Requirements and installation
The [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) toolbox is required to run all functions. 

- Download the [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) toolbox in the folder named "cvx" and add the folder into the path of your matlab. 
- Run the "Demo_GEM.m" file to get enhanced images.
